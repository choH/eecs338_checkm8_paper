## Abstract

[`checkm8`](https://github.com/axi0mX/ipwndfu) is a recently released (Sep 27, 2019) jailbreaking tool developed by [`axi0mX`](https://github.com/axi0mX). Being a jailbreak method targeting the BootROM (a.k.a `SecureROM`) of iOS devices, it is well-known for its unpatchable nature and strong compatibility across 11 generations of iOS devices. [This article](https://github.com/choH/eecs338_checkm8_paper/blob/master/article.pdf) is intended to give a brief introduction of `checkm8`, with a proper exposure of knowledge from the very concepts and needs of iOS jailbreaking, to the highlighted characters of `checkm8`, then to provide a relatively more technical walk-through on the hacking mechanism implemented in `checkm8`. In the end, it analyzes the philosophical reason behind this exploit and provides some potential solutions to prevent it from happening again.

## Disclaimer

As an assignment for an undergraduate course, the depth of this paper is certainly on the shallow side. Meanwhile some overviewing claims are probably not exactly accurate due to my limited understanding on the field of security.

This GitHub repo is published mainly for proofreading / sharing the developmental process (as `git-diff` highlights the changes). Please read with cautions, and never hesitate to submit an issue to grill me.
